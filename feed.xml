        <title>Hello, World!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A new blog, like an empty canvas, is full of possibilities. It is not
an accident that the creation of this blog coincides with the start of
my time as a PhD student at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.se.ewi.tudelft.nl/&quot;&gt;Software Engineering Research Group&lt;/a&gt;
of the Delft University of Technology. For the next four years I’ll be
studying declarative techniques for static analysis of domain specific
languges under supervision of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://eelcovisser.org/&quot;&gt;Eelco Visser&lt;/a&gt;. I’m very excited to see what
I can achieve in that time. Of course I hope to grow in academic
skill, but I’m also looking forward to meeting and collaborating with
smart people from all over the world. Most of what I plan to write
here will be about to my own research, or about interesting work of
others. Somewhere in the next month I want to kick off with a post
about my master thesis work, which is also the basis for my PhD
research. Until then!&lt;/p&gt;
